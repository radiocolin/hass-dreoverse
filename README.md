## Installation

**Note**: Dreo integration is currently in the process of being added to HACS. At present, only manual installation is available.

### HACS Installation

You can install this integration by adding this repository as a custom repository in HACS. Here's how:

1. Click the button below to download the integration from HACS:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=dreo-team&repository=hass-dreoverse&category=integration)

2. Restart your Home Assistant instance.

3. Start the config flow by clicking this button:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=dreo)

### Manual Installation

1. Copy the `dreo` directory into your `/config/custom_components` directory in your Home Assistant installation.

2. Restart your Home Assistant instance to load the integration.

**Note about dependencies**: This integration has `pydreo-cloud` library as a dependency (version 1.0.0), which is specified in the manifest.json file. When you restart Home Assistant after adding the integration (including in Docker environments), the system will automatically install the required dependencies. You do not need to manually install dependencies in most cases.

If for some reason the automatic installation fails, you can manually install the dependency:

```bash
pip install pydreo-cloud==1.0.0
```

## Initial Configuration

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you used the very early version of this that required editing `configuration.yaml`, you will need to do a one-time reconfiguration. Delete the configuration entries you added and then go through the configuration flow within HomeAssistant.

### Adding the Dreo Integration to Home Assistant

Follow these detailed steps to configure the Dreo integration after installation:

1. **Access Home Assistant Settings**:
